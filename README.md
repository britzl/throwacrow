# Angry Birds
Defold implementation of the popular game [Angry Birds by Rovio Entertainment](https://www.angrybirds.com/). The purpose of this project is to act as teaching material for creating a physics based game using Defold. The code in the main 'master' branch contains the beginnings of such a game and below you will find some exercises to add missing features and create a full game.

## Suggested exercises
1. Add a limited number of birds and let the UI reflect the number of birds left
2. Add scoring when blocks and pigs are destroyed
3. Make the pigs targetable and detect when all of them are killed
4. Make the explosive blocks actually explode
5. Adjust the camera zoom level to show all pigs plus the flung bird

## Improved version
An improved version of the game with the above features implemented can be found in the 'improved' branch.
